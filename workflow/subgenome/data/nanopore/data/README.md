## Data 

The data sets below are too large to be deposited and can be generated following the workflow rules.

+ WIV04.rep1.bed, WIV04.rep2.bed: 
    - BED12 format files for each Nanopore read
    - Generated by mapping/track.smk::WIV04_nanopore_bam2bed

+ WIV04.rep1.gap.bed, WIV04.rep2.gap.bed: 
    - BED6 format files for the junctions in each Nanopore read 
    - Generated by mapping/track.smk::WIV04_nanopore_gap
